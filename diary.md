# Work Log / Diary

This will be a work log / diary of what I have been doing in this project, just like a commit history, but simpler, more broad, explanatory.

This file only outlines the progress in this repository. All it's submodules will have their own work-log files.

> Starting this repo with the start of 2024. Let's see what 2024 has in store.

### 1st Jan 2024

- started the project structure
- decided to use git submodules
- learnt how to use and work with submodules
- accidentally made blunders with submodules (happens everytime I try out a new git feature)
- made respective changes in the next client and node server repositories
- set up my VS-Code workspace config
- added flags to be used in commit messages for better readability and navigation through commit history
- regretted not recording this session (would have been fun to start documenting it on YouTube)
